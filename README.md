# Typescript React path-finder

This is a small one weekend project I worked on. The project has been made for two reasons (or three if including being bored at my parents' place).

-   Making A\* more tangible for myself:
    At university we had a lecture about search algorithms, so actually applying the information myself helps with fully grasping the material.
-   Testing React with Typescript:
    I don't have an awfull lot of experience with React, but plan on using it in combination with typescript for a project called LaunchMenu. Seeing how well this works together (and figuring out that PReact doesn't work well at all with Typescript) was handy before fully commiting to it. Using the material-UI framework was also pleasant, which made me decide to make use of this in LaunchMenu as well.

Feel free to look at my source code (which I kept decently organised) or at [the actual result](https://tarvk.github.io/TypeScript-React-path-finder/build)
